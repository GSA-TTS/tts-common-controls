Customer Responsibility: The New Relic One Platform uses SAML SSO to provide federal customers the ability to leverage 
their internal account management and authentication infrastructure with the New Relic One Platform. 
New Relic One Platform SSO functionality allows federal customers to use their own PIV authenticators and 
FICAM third-party credentials to authenticate to the New Relic One Platform web interface. 
New Relic federal customers must implement SSO functionality in order to comply with FedRAMP requirements. 
For more information on federal customer user authentication, refer to IA-8
