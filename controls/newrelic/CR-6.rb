Customer Responsibility: New Relic uses SAML SSO to provide federal customers the ability to establish a trust relationship 
with their onsite account management systems with the New Relic SAML SSO. 
Once a trust relationship is established between a federal customerâ€™s account management system and the New Relic SAML SSO, 
federal customers will be able to integrate their existing identification and authentication actions with the New Relic One 
Platform environment. The SAML-based SSO will allow customers to leverage existing internal PIV capabilities and 
FICAM third-party credentials. In order to comply with FedRAMP requirements, New Relic customers must federate their
account management tool with the New Relic SAML SSO.

Controls Reference: SA-04(10)

Status: Implemented

The TTS Tech Portfolio has implemented SSO using SecureAuth. 
Security banners, warnings, and errors will be fully leveraged via SecureAuth.
