      provides what is commonly referred to as a Privacy Act Statement to all persons
      asked to provide personal information about themselves, which will go into a
      system of records [i.e., the information will be stored and retrieved using
      the individual’s name or other personal identifier such as a Social Security

      Act Statement for review by the GSA Privacy Office, the legal authority for
      collecting the information (statute, executive order, regulation, etc.) is included.

      This is a GSA provided common control which employs spam protection mechanisms
      at critical information system entry points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail
      servers, remote-access servers) and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing
      devices on the network.

      GSA utilizes Google Apps for Government for enterprise email and collaboration.  Google
      Apps is supported by strong Spam protection capabilities that automatically
      (through Gmail) help identify spam and suspicious emails by detecting viruses,
      finding patterns across messages, and learning from what Gmail users commonly
      mark as spam or phishing. Additionally, GSA implements Sender Policy Framework
      (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and implements Postini IP Lock.  SPF
      and IP Lock are mechanisms to prevent spoofing of messages originating from
      outside of the GSA.gov domain that are sent to GSA.gov addresses; DKIM provides
      message integrity.

      The organization uses the spam protection mechanisms to detect and take appropriate
      action on unsolicited messages transported by electronic mail, electronic mail
      attachments, Internet accesses, or other common means. Consideration is given
      to using spam protection software products from multiple vendors (e.g., using
      one vendor for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations).
